# bias-measurement

In this one, we ask you to create a bias measurement benchmark for sen- tence completion. Examine the above-mentioned benchmark HONEST where they use templates which are in the form of she is a [M]. and compare these to he is a [M]. while looking for hurtful completions. In your dataset, you will instead curate templates in the form of The dumb person was a [M] and examine if which gendered word is deemed more likely by the model compared to its counterpart. The number of tem- plates should be at least 1000 (the more the merrier). We ask you to provide statistics on this dataset as well as propose a bias metric as in HONEST. Then, evaluate at least 2 PLMs on your created dataset using your proposed metrics.

## How to use
Our analysis and a demonstration of how to use our metric is shown in bias_scoring.ipynb. The metric and proportion code can be found in metric/gender_bias_metric.py. The code for creation of templates is in templates.ipynb. The final templates are in templates.csv.
